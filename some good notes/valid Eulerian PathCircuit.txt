What conditions are required for a valid Eulerian Path/Circuit?

That depends on what kind of graph you're dealing with. Altogether there are four cases to consider:

1. Undirected Graph - Eulerian Circuit:
Every vertex must have an even degree.

2. Undirected Graph - Eulerian Path:
Either every vertex has an even degree, or exactly two vertices have an odd degree.

3. Directed Graph - Eulerian Circuit:
Every vertex must have equal indegree and outdegree.

4. Directed Graph - Eulerian Path:

At most one vertex has (outdegree - indegree) = 1

At most one vertex has (indegree - outdegree) = 1

All other vertices must have equal indegree and outdegree.
